# Scottie's Flashcards Project
I wrote this simple Angular app to help my kids with arithmetic operations. It's a simple browser application that uses the localstorage for settings. 

Some of the interesting aspects of this simple application is the interaction between the component view, component, and question service.

At the moment I have not yet hosted it anywhere. It allows the user to setup how many numbers are in a quiz as well as limits on the numbers in the equations. You will need to: 

1. Clone
2. Run **ng build** to compile
3. Run **ng serve** to use the Angular development server

I haven't had time to add unit tests for the services, etc. and it still needs a little work but the little details made it fun to code :-)
